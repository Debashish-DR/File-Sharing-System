This project is a **secure file sharing system** developed in **C++** using **POSIX sockets** and **OpenSSL (TLS 1.3)**.  
It demonstrates secure client–server communication with encryption, authentication, and safe file transfer.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
The server accepts TLS 1.3-secured TCP connections. Authenticated clients can:
- List files on the server  
- Download files  
- Upload files  

All actions are encrypted and logged.

Built as part of **Wipro Training – Capstone Project (Assignment 4)**.

## ⚙️ Features
- ✅ Client–Server communication over TCP sockets  
- ✅ TLS 1.3 encryption (OpenSSL)  
- ✅ User authentication (admin/user1/user2)  
- ✅ File upload & download with progress bars  
- ✅ Auto-create folders (server/client/logs)  
- ✅ Event logging (`server.log`, `security.log`)  
- ✅ Works on Linux / WSL (Ubuntu)

## 🚀 Setup & Run

### 1️⃣ Generate TLS Certificates
```bash
chmod +x generate_certs.sh
./generate_certs.sh
```

### 2️⃣ Build the Project
```bash
make clean && make
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Server
```bash
./server
```
Expected output:
```bash
=== Secure File Sharing Server (TLS 1.3) ===
🚀 Server started on port 9090
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Client
In another terminal:
```bash
./client
```
Login with:
```bash
Username: admin
Password: admin123
```

## 🖥️ Demo Workflow
1. Login as an existing user (e.g., `admin`)  
2. View the file list from the server  
3. Download and upload files securely  
4. Check the real-time logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/server.log logs/security.log
   ```
5. Verify TLS encryption:
   ```bash
   openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:9090 -tls1_3
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```bash
   Protocol  : TLSv1.3
   Cipher    : TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
   ```
